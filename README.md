This copy of the google home page is my first attempt at making a front-end website with html and CSS.

It was a very instructive experience, and I learned a lot by doing it.

1) I got some experience selecting elements using classes. I used them to mimic the layout of the site. Through trial and error I started to figure out how different css keywords work, when to use them etc,

2) I used the :hover( command to change the look of certain elements when the mouse hovered over them. For example, the search bar has a box-shadow around it when the mouse is over it.

3) I used flexbox commands to make the site look good at multiple screen sizes

4) I used bootstrap for some of my elements, and base CSS for others, and got a feel for when each approach is useful.
